# barman-barfly-prototype
Prototypes for the barman command line processor and the barfly file format...obviously.

**`barman`** is a command line cocktail spec processor. **Barfly** files (`.fly`) are a loose, human-readable, quasi-standardized format for cocktail specs that can be searched, modified, filtered, etc., by `barman`. We may be renaming the main program **`barbot`** to be more gender neutral in the future.

I'm not going to lie -- some of this is just to learn some of the [Pallets Projects](https://palletsprojects.com/) technologies, but it could be handy.
