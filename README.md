# barman-barfly-prototype
Prototypes for the barman command line processor and the barfly file format...obviously.

**`barman`** is a command line cocktail spec processor. **Barfly** files (`.fly`) are a loose, human-readable, quasi-stndardized format for cocktail specs that can be searched, modified, filtered, etc., by `barman`.
